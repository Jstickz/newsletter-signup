- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really leaned a lot from this project. I was able to do alot of research of how client side validation of user input on a form is being done. This helped me in understanding the importance of regular espression in validating the correspondance of an input that should fir a particular pattern.

Being a to maniputlate the default behavior of a form and making it easy for users to know the errors they are making in filling the for is really satisfying.

This project has also thought me how to navigate through different pages using JavaScript window.location method.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
ul:marker {

}
```
```js
window.localStorage.setItem("", )
window.localStorage.getItem("", )
window.location.href = "https://example.com"
```


### Continued development

I would like to work on trying to fully understand the client side validation for other input types.


### Useful resources
